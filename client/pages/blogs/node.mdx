# Getting Started with Node.js

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. If you're new to Node.js, this guide will help you get started with setting up Node.js on your machine and writing your first Node.js application.

## Installing Node.js

To begin, you'll need to install Node.js on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js:** Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Node.js:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Verify Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to check if Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

If you see version numbers for both Node.js and npm, congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js.

## Creating Your First Node.js Application

Now that you have Node.js installed, let's create a simple "Hello, World!" application.

1. **Create a Project Directory:** Create a new directory for your Node.js project and navigate into it using the terminal.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-node-app
   cd my-node-app
   ```

2. **Initialize Your Project:** Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file.

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Create Your JavaScript File:** Create a new file named `app.js` in your project directory and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

4. **Run Your Application:** In the terminal, run the following command to execute your Node.js application:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal, indicating that your Node.js application is running successfully.
